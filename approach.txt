Problem:
Write an application to compare two file entries, line by line. If they match, return matched, else, unmatched.

Constraints:
1. Follow good naming conventions. Follow a style-guide.
2. Write comments.
3. Write stubs/mocks first.
4. Write reusable code.
5. Write tests.
6. Write scalable code.
7. Use version controlling at all steps.

Naive Approach:
1. Read files line by line.
2. Compare each line if they are equal.

Better Approach:
1. Create a model class to save objects in the files through them.
2. Read both files and create a list of objects.
3. Compare those objects 1 on 1 using comparison method of the model class.

Good Approach (Reusable code):
1. Create a file reading class which handles reading of both classes.
2. Use file reader class to get object list from files.
3. Use comparison method of object class to compare 1 on 1.

Much Better Approach (More reusable code):
1. Create a generic file reading class which handles reading of both classes.
2. Use specified file reader class to get object list from files.
3. Use comparison method of object class to compare 1 on 1.

Wholesome Approach (Reusable code and TDD):
1. Create classes first.
2. Write methods with stubs.
3. Write units tests on those methods.
4. Run the tests.
5. Implement the classes.
6. Run the tests.
